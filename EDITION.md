# Content Edition

All the stores can be edited directly in a web browser. A set of keyboard shortcuts allows to create, modify, save, upload etc. store items.

## Shortcuts
* `alt-e` edit the current item (collection or single item)
* `alt-n` create a new (single) item
* `alt-f` create a new collection (f like folder)
* `alt-x` delete the current item (item or collection). This operation is automatically saved.
* `alt-c` copy the current item ID into the clipboard. This is useful before setting the list of collection items.

### Undo / Redo
* `alt-z` undo the last **saved** operation 
* `alt-y` redo the last **undone** operation 

### File operations
* `alt-s` download to a local file all saved modifications (so that it can be shared with others)
* `alt-o` load a local file (containing saved modifications)
* `alt-d` download the complete store (so that it can be uploaded to the server)

### Other
* `alt-l` open the logs of saved operations
* `alt-r` reset all **saved** operations. Better consult the logs before doing this...
