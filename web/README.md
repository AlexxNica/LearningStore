# LearningStore

The Nokia Learning Store is an application that will direct you to today's hottest learning offers: products, technology and business skills.

The Learning Store eliminates the need for lengthy searches and multiple access points to find relevant learning resources. Clear, simple icons point users to key learning topics while a left menu bar specifies user groups and topics.

The Learning Store is one place to browse for all your learning needs. A recognizable and understandable format patterned after today's most familiar on-line applications.
